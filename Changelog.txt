ver 20100224
Highres Font problems with
+Secret of Mana,
+Seiken Densetsu 3 and
+Rudra of Hibou solved.
+Soul Blazer works now (i think only the german version was not working!?)

Notes:
+I added ZIP support (one ROM -> one ZIPfile)
-I deactivate Fullscreen for now, because it's not working with Font Highres mode.
-Most DSP1 Games should work. But slow. Very slow.
-I actived threaded Soundsystem. Maybe this improves Sound-Speed.

ver 20100221
+support for SDD1 Emu added (GraphicPack NOT needed anymore!! -> removed)
+Street Fighter Alpha 2 & Star Ocean (all work)

ver 20100218
+Added Star Ocean support using the Star Ocean Grpahic Set.
