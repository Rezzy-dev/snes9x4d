This is meant to be a list of the most important changes over the last releases
of the emulator Snes9x4P. The listed versions numbers are identical to the
version numbers reflected by the PXML.


Changes in "1.39ff.20111205.2" compared to "1.39ff.20111205.1":
* New version of picklelauncher (based on r8 of pickles svn repo).

Changes in "1.39ff.20111205.1" compared to "1.39ff.20111204.1":
* Allow hardware scaling for HiRes Games, too.
* Default to the hardware scaled 4:3 mode when nothing is/was selected yet or an
  invalid mode is selected.
* Only display scaling modes that are actually supported (limited support of
  scaling modes for HiRes (no scale2x and smooth)).
* Fixed display of the framecounter when in HW scaling mode.
* Fixed switching through scaling modes using the keyboard key 's' to include
  all modes.
* VSync should now work correctly again.

Changes in "1.39ff.20111204.1" compared to "1.39ff.20111010.2":
* Added notaz libsdl and based on this added some hardware scaling capabilities
  (all using the full height but only work for LowRes Roms (no Secret of Mana)):
  - fullscreen
  - 4:3
  - 8:7 (aspect ratio used internally for NTSC)
  - 8:7,5 (aspect ratio used internally for PAL)
* Fixed menu to display more nicely when switching through display modes.

Changes in "1.39ff.20111010.2" compared to "1.39ff.20111010.1"
* Safe rom specific settings like the savestate slot used, display mode, ...
  into ROMNAME.scfg in the folder where the SRAMs and savestates are stored,
  too.

Changes in "1.39ff.20111010.1" compared to "1.39ff.20110310.2"
* Allow to switch to alternative sound decoding mode using the emulator menu.
  This is required to make sounds effects sound better for some games, especially
  games from squaresoft.
* Fixed the run script to actually allow the usage of an "args.txt" file to
  supply different commandline arguments to the emulator. 



Older, pre repo.o.o changes not following the latest version numbering scheme:

Changes in v20110310:
* Updated to the latest version of PickleLauncher.

Changes in v20110214:
* Support subfolders in 7z archives. Please be aware that it will take *ages* to
  load if you select a rom from a larger 7z archive since the whole archive is
  processed during temporary unpacking!

Changes in v20110213:
* Fixed 7z support. Now it should work "for real" even with larger archives with
  several files and if there are things like spaces and more than one '.' in the
  filename.
* Updated to the latest snes9x4X version. This introduces eg support for
  switching of transparency which can give some more speed but should not be
  required on the pandora (thus transparency is active by default).
* Used the latest toolchain to compile it. This might lead to some really tiny
  speed improvements, though I would not bet on it...

Changes in v20101111:
* Added Scale2x support for LowRes games. This is basically the "normal" mode
  with some slight smoothing, speed is close to "2x2 no-AA" mode. Thanks to Pickle
  for implementing this.
* Fixed display of HiRes games in 2x2 mode, now *real* HiRes is used there
  (meaning that fonts should look decent now!).

Changes in v20101106:
* Added smooth scaling support for LowRes games. This currently requires massive
  overclocking (>=800MHz) to run rather smooth. Thanks to WizardStan for
  implementing this.

Changes in v20101028:
* All games, no matter if LowRes or HiRes, PAL or NTSC should now be centered
  horizontally as well as vertically.
* Tiny (really tiny!) performance improvements.

Changes in v20101027:
* Center the screen when playing a HiRes game (eg Secret of Mana).
* Implement 3x2 display mode for HiRes games.
